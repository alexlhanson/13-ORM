#Single Resource Mongo and Express API
===

### Feature Tasks
* creates an HTTP Server using `express`
* creates a resource **model** that uses `mongoose.Schema` and `mongoose.model`
* uses the `body-parser` express middleware to parse the `req` body on `POST` and `PUT` requests
* uses the npm `debug` module to log the functions and methods that are being used in your application
* uses the express `Router` to create a route for doing **RESTFUL CRUD** operations against your _model_

## Server Endpoints
### `/api/resource-name`
* `POST` request
  * should pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a post request to create a new resource

### `/api/resource-name/:id`
* `GET` request
  * should pass the id of a resource through the url endpoint to get a resource
    * **this should use `req.params`, not querystring parameters**
* `PUT` request
  * should pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a put request to overwrite a pre-existing resource
* `PATCH` request
    * should pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a put request to update a pre-existing resource
* `DELETE` request
  * should pass the id of a resource though the url endpoint to delete a resource
    * **this should use `req.params`**

### Tests
* Tests will ensure that the API returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered
* Tests ensure that `/api/resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
  * `GET` - test 200, returns a resource with a valid body
 * `GET` - test 404, respond with 'not found' for valid requests made with an id that was not found
 * `PUT` - test 200, returns a resource with an updated body
 * `PUT` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' if no request body was provided
 * `PUT` - test 404, responds with 'not found' for valid requests made with an id that was not found
 * `POST` - test 400, responds with 'bad request' if no request body was provided
 * `POST` - test 200, returns a resource for requests made with a valid body
